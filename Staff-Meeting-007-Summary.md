# General Remarks
- Staff have decided on a new approach to branches. `stable` has become `release`, and `master` has become `canary`. The new default branch will be `release`. Strict bug fixes will be merged directly into `release`. Features will go to new branches based on `release`, then also merged into `canary`. When the feature is deemed "safe" after a trial period in `canary`, it will be merged into `release`.
- ibm2431 plans to coordinate with aether in regards to documentation for the Blue Mage project focus
- Staff is excited to see so much support and general positivity in the community.
