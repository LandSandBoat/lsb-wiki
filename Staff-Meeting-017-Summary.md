# Opening Remarks
> Welcome back! I hope that the Return Home to Vana'diel campaign was eventful! Due to the amount of Pull Requests that were submitted during the campaign, we will not be discussing open Pull Requests today so as to allow staff more time to resolve smaller Pull Requests without having to worry about larger Pull Requests immediately upon return from the campaign.

# General Remarks
